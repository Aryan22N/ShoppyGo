    /cart.js          // Shopping cart page
    /checkout.js      // Checkout page
    /api
        /products.js    // API route for products

## 3. Routing Structure

- **Home (`/`)**: Displays featured products and categories.
- **Product Details (`/products/[id]`)**: Dynamic route showing details for a selected product.
- **Cart (`/cart`)**: Shows items added to the shopping cart.
- **Checkout (`/checkout`)**: Handles order placement and payment.
- **API Routes (`/api/*`)**: Backend endpoints for products and orders.

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **User visits Home Page (`/`)**

   - Product listings are fetched from the API.
   - User can browse and select products.

2. **User views Product Details (`/products/[id]`)**

   - Dynamic route loads product info based on the `id` parameter.
   - User can add product to cart.

3. **User accesses Cart (`/cart`)**

   - Displays all products added.
   - User can update quantities or remove items.

4. **User proceeds to Checkout (`/checkout`)**

   - User enters shipping and payment details.
   - Order is submitted via API.

5. **API Routes**
   - `/api/products`: Handles product data (fetch, create, update).
   - `/api/orders`: Handles order creation and retrieval.

---

## 5. Additional Features

- Authentication (if implemented): Protects checkout and order history routes.
- Admin Panel (optional): For managing products and orders.

---

## 6. Technologies Used

- Next.js (React framework)
- Node.js (API routes)
- CSS/SCSS for styling
- Optional: MongoDB, Stripe, Auth libraries
